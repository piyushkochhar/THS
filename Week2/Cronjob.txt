1) Set up a cron job which creates a new text in the path ~/ file every
20 seconds.
Note:
a) The Text File Name should be the system TIME while
executing.
b)The Text File Content should be the system DATE.

Solution:

script.sh
—————
echo $(date +%Y-%m-%d) > $(date +\%H-\%M-\%S)


Cronjob
—————
* * * * * bash script.sh
* * * * * sleep 20; bash script.sh
* * * * * sleep 40; bash script.sh
